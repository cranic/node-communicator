node-communicator
=================

Communicator aims to be an intermediate between client and server using the old  and good RPC over HTTP method.
Currently it's handling XML and JSON request.

#### Main features

* Modular: each file in a folder is a method, and every exported function in that file is an action.
* Versioned endpoints: you can have multiple endpoints with different versions, ex: /api/0.1 and /api/2.1
* Multiple protocols: currently we have support for JSON and XML, but more protocols like YAML can be implemented in the future.

#### Installation

1 - Install by npm: `npm install communicator`    
2 - Create a folder for handling the methods:

    |- myapp
       |- app.js
       |- rpc <-- created folder

3 - Create a file in that folder, the name of the file will be the name of the method.

    |- myapp
       |- app.js
       |- rpc
          |- user.js <-- created file

4 - Export functions inside that file, every exported function will be an action.

user.js

    exports.add = function(req, params, callback){
        // do your user adding logic here ;)
        // we pass null to the first callback parameter 
        // indicating that there was no error
        callback(null, {
            "message" : "User added!",
            "params" : {
                "username" : "foobar"
            }
        });
    }

    exports.remove = function(req, params, callback){
        // this time we will return an error
        callback({
            "message" : "Oops, we got an error here...",
            "params" : {
                "username" : "foobar"
            }
        });
    }

    exports.echo = function(req, params, callback){
        // A simple echo on the params
        callback(null, {
            "message" : "Echo system.",
            "params" : params
        });
    }

5 - Configure Express:

app.js

    var express = require('express');
    var app = express();
    var com = require('communicator');

    app.use(com.express({
        debug : true, //enabling debug messages, default: false
        endpoint : '/api', //change de endpoint of the api, default: '/api'
        version : '1.0' //change the endpoint version, default: '1.0'
    }));

    app.get('/', function(req, res){
      res.send('Hello World');
    });

    app.listen(80);

Now we are good to go, spin up you `app.js` and start making your requests:

    POST http://localhost/api/1.0
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "method" : "user.echo", 
        "params" : {
            "foo" : "bar"
        }
    }

    ---> RESPONSE
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "error": false,
        "message": "Echo system.",
        "params": {
            "lol": "kel"
        }
    }

    POST http://localhost/api/1.0
    Content-Type: application/xml

    <request>
        <method>user.add</method>
        <params>
            <foo>bar</foo>
        </params>
    </request>

    ---> RESPONSE
    Content-Type: application/xml
    
    <response>
        <error>false</error>
        <message>User added!</message>
        <params>
            <username>foobar</username>
        </params>
    </response>

You can easy build an jQuery extension for handling requests :)
